              <p style="font-size: 1.25em">Sejong the Great was the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty of Korea. One of the biggest and most influential work of Sejong the Great is the invention of Hangul, the Korean alphabet.<br><br>Hangul was created in 1443 in order to improve literacy rate in the country and establish cultural identity. Before Hangul, Korea did not have its own alphabets, so modified Chinese characters were used for writing. However, the sentence structures and grammatical differences between Korean and Chinese languages made it difficult to learn allowing only the members of high class to be literate.<br><br>Each of the 28 letters of Hangul was created based on the shape of human speech organs when the sound is made. These letters are joined together to make a block of letters for each syllable.<br><br>Hangul is fairly easy to learn as a foreigner can learn to read and write Hangul in a few hours. For this reason, a tribe in Indonesia chose Hangul as their official writing system in 2009.<br><br>Sejong the Great's work of Hangul creation has not only helped improve the literacy rate of Korea dramatically, but also allowed others to record their own spoken language, proving the excellence of Hangul.</p>
